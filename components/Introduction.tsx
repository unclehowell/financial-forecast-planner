        Platinum Luxury Transportation Ltd. is a newly established, fully foreign-owned company managed to European standards. The share capital stands at GBP 5,000,000, divided into 5,000,000 outstanding shares valued at GBP 1 each.
      </p>
      <p>
        The company is awaiting European Central Bank certification to issue bonds valued at USD 1,000,000 to raise capital from investors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Operating at a much higher standard than typical businesses in the Dominican Republic (DR), we are experiencing growing demand for luxury services. After successfully running smaller-scale car rental and transportation businesses for three years, we now aim to expand to meet the demand for luxury-oriented services.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will provide luxury VIP transfers for 5-star hotels in Punta Cana, partnering with establishments such as the Hard Rock Hotel and Live Aqua Hotel. Fixed-term contracts will cover the entire vehicle fleet, guaranteeing a minimum 2-year period, renewable for an additional 2 years. This strategy will fuel accelerated growth.
